##TechExpress
An administration interface for an online computer hardware store.

##To Install
Run on a server (or XAMPP) and open your PHPMyAdmin.
Import the techexpress.sql file and run it so that it populates the database.
Finally, create a new user with the following (dummy) information:

	USER: techexpress
	PW: lamepassword
	Host: localhost (or your server's, would need more changes)

##To Use
Open up localhost or your server.
You'll be able to navigate, login, and access the Admin panel.


Enjoy!
